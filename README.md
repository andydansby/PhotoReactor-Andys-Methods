# PhotoReactor-Andys-Methods
my methods for plugins

Not all methods work, all of them are works in progress


IPlugin.h - photoReactor standard include file, abstract class

pyramid.h - this group of methods will be used to decompose / recompose image pyramids.  This group is flawed and needs work


colorspace.h - this group of methods decompose images into different color spaces, assume the image is in the 0-1 range



smallKernels.h - this group of methods is used for various kernels, needs work, however the LaPlacian kernel is implemented.  Assume the image is 0-1 range.
